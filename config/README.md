## Custom Configurations used in Live-SWE-agent

For base use cases, we provide the following config: `livesweagent.yaml`

### Paper results

To reproduce the results in the paper, we built custom configs specifically for SWE-bench and SWE-Bench Pro by modifying the custom SWE-bench config used in mini-swe-agent.

You can find them as `livesweagent_swebench.yaml` and `livesweagent_swebenchpro.yaml`
